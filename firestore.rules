/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Roemah Jumpoetan Palembang application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data (users, shopping carts, orders) and allows public read access to product and testimonial data.
 * Authorization decisions are made independently, without relying on external `get()` calls, to optimize performance and security.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores personal user data. Only the authenticated user can access their own document.
 * - /users/{userId}/addresses/{addressId}: Stores user's shipping addresses. Only the owning user can manage them.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product catalog data. Publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/shoppingCarts/{shoppingCartId}: Stores a user's shopping cart. Only the owning user can access.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}: Stores a user's order history. Only the owning user can access.
 * - /testimonials/{testimonialId}: Stores customer testimonials. Publicly readable, and now creatable by authenticated users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Public read access is granted for the products and testimonials collections.
 * - Authenticated users are now allowed to create testimonials.
 * - Write access to products remains restricted in this prototyping phase.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  N/A - The data model inherently supports authorization independence, as each secured entity either resides under a user-owned path or is intended for public read access.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The data model uses structural segregation to separate public content (products, testimonials) from private, user-specific data (users, shopping carts, orders).
