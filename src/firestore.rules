/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Roemah Jumpoetan Palembang application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data (users, shopping carts, orders) and allows public read access to product and testimonial data.
 * Authorization decisions are made independently, without relying on external `get()` calls, to optimize performance and security.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores personal user data. Only the authenticated user can access their own document. A 'role' field governs admin/owner access.
 * - /users/{userId}/addresses/{addressId}: Stores user's shipping addresses. Only the owning user can manage them.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product catalog data. Publicly readable.
 * - /products/{productId}/ratings/{ratingId}: Stores ratings for a product. Writable by authenticated users, readable by admins.
 * - /users/{userId}/shoppingCarts/{shoppingCartId}: Stores a user's shopping cart. Only the owning user can access.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores order history for all users. Writable by authenticated users, readable by admins.
 * - /testimonials/{testimonialId}: Stores customer testimonials. Publicly readable, and now creatable by authenticated users.
 * - /purchasedRawMaterials/{materialId}: Stores raw material purchases. Accessible only to admin/owner roles.
 * - /usedRawMaterials/{usageId}: Stores raw material usages. Accessible only to admin/owner roles.
 * - /inboundFinishedGoods/{inboundId}: Records of finished goods entering warehouse. Accessible only to admin/owner.
 * - /outboundFinishedGoods/{outboundId}: Records of finished goods leaving warehouse. Accessible only to admin/owner.
 * - /sewingJobs/{jobId}: Records of jobs assigned to tailors. Accessible by authenticated users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed for non-admins but allowed for admins.
 * - Public read access is granted for the products and testimonials collections.
 * - Authenticated users are now allowed to create testimonials and product ratings.
 * - Write access to products remains restricted to admins.
 * - The `role` field on a user document is protected.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  N/A - The data model inherently supports authorization independence, as each secured entity either resides under a user-owned path or is intended for public read access.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The data model uses structural segregation to separate public content (products, testimonials) from private, user-specific data (users, shopping carts, orders, ratings).
